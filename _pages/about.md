I am a neuroscientist interested in higher-order cognitive functions in health and disease. In particular, I study visual perception, memory systems and age-related cognitive decline. My research uses an integrative approach by combining behavioral tasks with multimodal neuroimaging and computational models to better understand the neural underpinnings of human cognition.

I obtained my PhD in psychology at Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg and completed my first postdoctoral training in Clinical Memory Research Unit at Lund University. Currently, I am a postdoc in the Department of Neuropsychology at Ruhr University Bochum.
